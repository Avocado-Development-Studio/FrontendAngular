# Pwa

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.0-next.0.

## Development server

Run `http-server -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`. The application will not reload if you change any of the source files, because it not `ng serve`. Don't even try to use "ng serve" because it's a ready-made project. If you want to use `ng serve` for development, then you need to download and replace the files in your project in the `dist/project-name` directory, this also applies to all other `ng ` commands.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build --configuration "production" --base-href "https://github.com/Avocado-Development-Studio/FrontendAngular"` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/pwa` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
